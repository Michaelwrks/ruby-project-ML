# Installing packages

2. On the terminal type 'bundle install' to insall all dependencies needed. After doing this you can straight away launch the server using 'bin/rails server'. Click on the 'Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000' while holding command at the same time. If you get an error run 'bin/rails assets:precompile' on the terminal and then run the server again.
